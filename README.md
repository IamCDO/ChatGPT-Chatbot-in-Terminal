# ChatGPT-Chatbot-Terminal Using the Python Programming Language:
This creates a chat session with chatGPT in your terminal using the gpt-4o-mini model by connecting to the OpenAI API, ChatGPT doesn't store your chat with it over the API connection, so after each query you make, it losses memory of the query(inputs of the user) made, hence, I created a database using sqlite3 to store all the queries(inputs of the user) made by the user, this storing of the previous questions allows me to pass the previous queries(inputs of the user) to each new query given to the chatbot(right now, only two of the previous queries are given with each new one, we could increase how many we give), and as such, there is better response in terms of context when the chatbot has to answer a question that was related to the previous one asked.
