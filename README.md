# ChatGPT-Chatbot-Terminal-
This creates a chat session with chatGPT in your terminal using the gpt-4o-mini model by connecting to the OpenAI API, ChatGPT doesn't store your chat with over the API connection, so after each query you make, it losses memory of it, hence, I created a database using sqlite3 to store the last two queries(questions) made by the user, this storing of the previous two questions allows me to pass the questions with each query made to the chatbot, and as such, there is better response in terms of context when the chatbot has to answer a question that was related to the previous one asked.
